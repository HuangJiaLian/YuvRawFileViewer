Simplify the project on https://github.com/hybridego/YuvRawFileViewer.git 
to show the image with the Y channel only.

Usage:
python yuvViewer.py filename w h YUV420P

Tips:
For windows user, you can use the "yuvViewer.exe" file at the cmd, or 
use the autorun script "run.bat" to use the program without typing 
the command each time

Maybe you need you change the "run.bat" script a little to fit you own need.
